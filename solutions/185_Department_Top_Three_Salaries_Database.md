## 🧩 Problem Description

Table: `Employee`



+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| id           | int     |
| name         | varchar |
| salary       | int     |
| departmentId | int     |
+--------------+---------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
departmentId is a foreign key (reference column) of the ID from the `Department `table.
Each row of this table indicates the ID, name, and salary of an employee. It also contains the ID of their department.


 


Table: `Department`



+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the ID of a department and its name.


 


A company&#39;s executives are interested in seeing who earns the most money in each of the company&#39;s departments. A **high earner** in a department is an employee who has a salary in the **top three unique** salaries for that department.


Write a solution to find the employees who are **high earners** in each of the departments.


Return the result table **in any order**.


The result format is in the following example.


 

<strong class="example">Example 1:**



**Input:** 
Employee table:
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| id | name  | salary | departmentId |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| 1  | Joe   | 85000  | 1            |
| 2  | Henry | 80000  | 2            |
| 3  | Sam   | 60000  | 2            |
| 4  | Max   | 90000  | 1            |
| 5  | Janet | 69000  | 1            |
| 6  | Randy | 85000  | 1            |
| 7  | Will  | 70000  | 1            |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
Department table:
+----+-------+
| id | name  |
+----+-------+
| 1  | IT    |
| 2  | Sales |
+----+-------+
**Output:** 
+------------+----------+--------+
| Department | Employee | Salary |
+------------+----------+--------+
| IT         | Max      | 90000  |
| IT         | Joe      | 85000  |
| IT         | Randy    | 85000  |
| IT         | Will     | 70000  |
| Sales      | Henry    | 80000  |
| Sales      | Sam      | 60000  |
+------------+----------+--------+
**Explanation:** 
In the IT department:
- Max earns the highest unique salary
- Both Randy and Joe earn the second-highest unique salary
- Will earns the third-highest unique salary

In the Sales department:
- Henry earns the highest salary
- Sam earns the second-highest salary
- There is no third-highest salary as there are only two employees


 

**Constraints:**



	- There are no employees with the **exact** same name, salary *and* department.

## 💻 My Solution

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT D.name AS Department,
       E1.name AS Employee,
       E1.salary AS Salary
FROM Employee E1
JOIN Department D
ON E1.departmentId = D.id
WHERE (
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT E2.salary)
    FROM Employee E2
    WHERE E2.departmentId = E1.departmentId
      AND E2.salary > E1.salary
) < 3;

```

## 🧪 Sample Test Case

```
{"headers": {"Employee": ["id", "name", "salary", "departmentId"], "Department": ["id", "name"]}, "rows": {"Employee": [[1, "Joe", 85000, 1], [2, "Henry", 80000, 2], [3, "Sam", 60000, 2], [4, "Max", 90000, 1], [5, "Janet", 69000, 1], [6, "Randy", 85000, 1], [7, "Will", 70000, 1]], "Department": [[1, "IT"], [2, "Sales"]]}}
```

## 🔍 Approach & Intuition

> This problem primarily involves **Database** techniques.
> The key insight is to leverage `O(n)` time complexity
> by applying database to efficiently reach the solution.
> Space usage is kept at `O(1)` by optimizing auxiliary structures.
