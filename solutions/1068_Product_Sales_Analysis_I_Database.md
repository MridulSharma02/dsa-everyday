## 🧩 Problem Description

Table: `Sales`



+-------------+-------+
| Column Name | Type  |
+-------------+-------+
| sale_id     | int   |
| product_id  | int   |
| year        | int   |
| quantity    | int   |
| price       | int   |
+-------------+-------+
(sale_id, year) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) of this table.
product_id is a foreign key (reference column) to `Product` table.
Each row of this table shows a sale on the product product_id in a certain year.
Note that the price is per unit.


 


Table: `Product`



+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| product_id   | int     |
| product_name | varchar |
+--------------+---------+
product_id is the primary key (column with unique values) of this table.
Each row of this table indicates the product name of each product.


 


Write a solution to report the `product_name`, `year`, and `price` for each `sale_id` in the `Sales` table.


Return the resulting table in **any order**.


The result format is in the following example.


 

<strong class="example">Example 1:**



**Input:** 
Sales table:
+---------+------------+------+----------+-------+
| sale_id | product_id | year | quantity | price |
+---------+------------+------+----------+-------+ 
| 1       | 100        | 2008 | 10       | 5000  |
| 2       | 100        | 2009 | 12       | 5000  |
| 7       | 200        | 2011 | 15       | 9000  |
+---------+------------+------+----------+-------+
Product table:
+------------+--------------+
| product_id | product_name |
+------------+--------------+
| 100        | Nokia        |
| 200        | Apple        |
| 300        | Samsung      |
+------------+--------------+
**Output:** 
+--------------+-------+-------+
| product_name | year  | price |
+--------------+-------+-------+
| Nokia        | 2008  | 5000  |
| Nokia        | 2009  | 5000  |
| Apple        | 2011  | 9000  |
+--------------+-------+-------+
**Explanation:** 
From sale_id = 1, we can conclude that Nokia was sold for 5000 in the year 2008.
From sale_id = 2, we can conclude that Nokia was sold for 5000 in the year 2009.
From sale_id = 7, we can conclude that Apple was sold for 9000 in the year 2011.

## 💻 My Solution

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT product_name,year,price
FROM Sales AS S
LEFT JOIN Product AS P
ON S.product_id=p.product_id;

```

---

## 🧪 Sample Test Case

```
{"headers":{"Sales":["sale_id","product_id","year","quantity","price"],"Product":["product_id","product_name"]},"rows":{"Sales":[[1,100,2008,10,5000],[2,100,2009,12,5000],[7,200,2011,15,9000]],"Product":[[100,"Nokia"],[200,"Apple"],[300,"Samsung"]]}}
```

## 🔍 Approach & Intuition

> This problem primarily involves **Database** techniques.
> The key insight is to leverage `O(n)` time complexity
> by applying database to efficiently reach the solution.
> Space usage is kept at `O(1)` by optimizing auxiliary structures.
