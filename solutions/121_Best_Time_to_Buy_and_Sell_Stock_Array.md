## 🧩 Problem Description

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i^th` day.


You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day** to buy one stock and choosing a **different day in the future** to sell that stock.


Return *the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction*. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.


 

<strong class="example">Example 1:**



**Input:** prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.


<strong class="example">Example 2:**



**Input:** prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.


 

**Constraints:**



	- `1 <= prices.length <= 10^5`
	- `0 <= prices[i] <= 10^4`

## 💻 My Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int mn=INT_MAX;
        int profit=0;
        for(int price:prices){
            mn=min(mn,price);
            profit=max(profit,price-mn);
        }

        return profit;
    }
};

```

## 🧪 Sample Test Case

```
[7,1,5,3,6,4]
```

## 🔍 Approach & Intuition

> This problem primarily involves **Array** techniques.
> The key insight is to leverage `O(n²)` time complexity
> by applying array to efficiently reach the solution.
> Space usage is kept at `O(n)` by optimizing auxiliary structures.
