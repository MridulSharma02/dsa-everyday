## 🧩 Problem Description

Table: `Signups`



+----------------+----------+
| Column Name    | Type     |
+----------------+----------+
| user_id        | int      |
| time_stamp     | datetime |
+----------------+----------+
user_id is the column of unique values for this table.
Each row contains information about the signup time for the user with ID user_id.


 


Table: `Confirmations`



+----------------+----------+
| Column Name    | Type     |
+----------------+----------+
| user_id        | int      |
| time_stamp     | datetime |
| action         | ENUM     |
+----------------+----------+
(user_id, time_stamp) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
user_id is a foreign key (reference column) to the Signups table.
action is an ENUM (category) of the type (&#39;confirmed&#39;, &#39;timeout&#39;)
Each row of this table indicates that the user with ID user_id requested a confirmation message at time_stamp and that confirmation message was either confirmed (&#39;confirmed&#39;) or expired without confirming (&#39;timeout&#39;).


 


The **confirmation rate** of a user is the number of `&#39;confirmed&#39;` messages divided by the total number of requested confirmation messages. The confirmation rate of a user that did not request any confirmation messages is `0`. Round the confirmation rate to **two decimal** places.


Write a solution to find the **confirmation rate** of each user.


Return the result table in **any order**.


The result format is in the following example.


 

<strong class="example">Example 1:**



**Input:** 
Signups table:
+---------+---------------------+
| user_id | time_stamp          |
+---------+---------------------+
| 3       | 2020-03-21 10:16:13 |
| 7       | 2020-01-04 13:57:59 |
| 2       | 2020-07-29 23:09:44 |
| 6       | 2020-12-09 10:39:37 |
+---------+---------------------+
Confirmations table:
+---------+---------------------+-----------+
| user_id | time_stamp          | action    |
+---------+---------------------+-----------+
| 3       | 2021-01-06 03:30:46 | timeout   |
| 3       | 2021-07-14 14:00:00 | timeout   |
| 7       | 2021-06-12 11:57:29 | confirmed |
| 7       | 2021-06-13 12:58:28 | confirmed |
| 7       | 2021-06-14 13:59:27 | confirmed |
| 2       | 2021-01-22 00:00:00 | confirmed |
| 2       | 2021-02-28 23:59:59 | timeout   |
+---------+---------------------+-----------+
**Output:** 
+---------+-------------------+
| user_id | confirmation_rate |
+---------+-------------------+
| 6       | 0.00              |
| 3       | 0.00              |
| 7       | 1.00              |
| 2       | 0.50              |
+---------+-------------------+
**Explanation:** 
User 6 did not request any confirmation messages. The confirmation rate is 0.
User 3 made 2 requests and both timed out. The confirmation rate is 0.
User 7 made 3 requests and all were confirmed. The confirmation rate is 1.
User 2 made 2 requests where one was confirmed and the other timed out. The confirmation rate is 1 / 2 = 0.5.

## 💻 My Solution

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT S.user_id,IFNULL(ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN action = 'confirmed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)/COUNT(action),2),0) AS confirmation_rate
FROM Signups AS S
LEFT JOIN Confirmations AS C
ON S.user_id=C.user_id
GROUP BY user_id;

```

## 🧪 Sample Test Case

```
{"headers": {"Signups": ["user_id", "time_stamp"], "Confirmations": ["user_id", "time_stamp", "action"]}, "rows": {"Signups": [[3, "2020-03-21 10:16:13"], [7, "2020-01-04 13:57:59"], [2, "2020-07-29 23:09:44"], [6, "2020-12-09 10:39:37"]], "Confirmations": [[3, "2021-01-06 03:30:46", "timeout"], [3, "2021-07-14 14:00:00", "timeout"], [7, "2021-06-12 11:57:29", "confirmed"], [7, "2021-06-13 12:58:28", "confirmed"], [7, "2021-06-14 13:59:27", "confirmed"], [2, "2021-01-22 00:00:00", "confirmed"], [2, "2021-02-28 23:59:59", "timeout"]]}}
```

## 🔍 Approach & Intuition

> This problem primarily involves **Database** techniques.
> The key insight is to leverage `O(n)` time complexity
> by applying database to efficiently reach the solution.
> Space usage is kept at `O(1)` by optimizing auxiliary structures.
